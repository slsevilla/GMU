# 3. Principal components and rotation 
#
# Below we keep the original units of
# measure by setting scale to FALSE
# Otherwise after centering the
# variables, prcomp will divide them by 
# their standard deviations so the
# variables being rotated are unitless.  
#
# In most situations the variables
# have different units of measure
# and researchers usually choose to divide the
# variables by their standard deviation
# to produce unitless values. Then
# the rotated values (linear combination
# of the variables) are also unitless. 
# If they are using R they will chose
# scale=TRUE.   
# 
# There is related but somewhat
# different numerical method for
# computing principal components. 
# The scale=TRUE options corresponds
# to using correlation matrix in
# the eigenvector method. 

# With scale=FALSE both
# variables remain expressed as 
# deaths per 100000 people. Rotation will 
# produce new coordinates in the same
# units of measure, deaths per 100000.
# The correspond to using covariance
# matrix in eigenvector numerical method.
   
# It much harder to interpret linear
# combinations of variables when the 
# origin variables have different units
# of measure.    

pc <- prcomp(mat,scale=FALSE)
pcDat <- pc$x # principal components
pcRotate <- pc$rotation  #rotation matrix

# Verify this is a rotation or
# or a rotation with reflections.  
# Reflections are possible
#   We can multiple any pc column by -1
#   and retain the center, variance and
#   orthogonality to other pc's 
   
# The determinant of a rotation matrix is 1. 
# If there are an odd number of reflections
# about the axes, the determinant will be -1. 

det(pcRotate)  # -1 means there is a reflection 

# Rotate the centered data and compare

matRot <- matCen %*% pcRotate
head(pcDat)
head(matRot)

round(pcRotate,2)

# Look at the first column in the
# rotation matrix above. The first principal
# component is approximately 
# -.78 times the centered male vector plus
# -.63 times the centered female vector. 

# A rotation matrix for angle a in 2D
# has form 
#          sin(a)  cos(a)
#         -cos(a)  sin(a)
# The determinant is sin(a)**2 + cos(a)**2 = 1
#
# The reflection here has form
#          -sin(a)  cos(a)
#           cos(a)  sin(a)
# The determinant is -(sin(a)**2) -(cos(a)**2) = -1

a <- -pcRotate[1,1]
asin(a)*180/pi

# In 4. below, think of clockwise rotation
# of 51 degrees about the origin and then
# multiplying the resulting x coordinates
# by -1 to put West Virginia on left    

# 4. Juxtapose the centered data and  
#    principle component scatterplots
#    using the same x and y axis scale
#    limits.
#
#  Find x and y axis limits to accommodate
#  rotating the data.  
#  The first principal component has 
#  large variance but not necessarily
#  the point furthest from the origin

# The warning message is not a problem
# The plan was to show just 3 of the
# 51 state codes.

# From the left panel to the right panel there
# is roughly a 135 degree rotation. Look at the
# script above to see that y=-PC2. Actually
# there was also a reflection about the y-axis.
# Think a 45 degree clockwise rotaton and the hte
# x values were mulitple by -1.       

# Multiplying a principal component by -1 does
# not change the two basic properties. 

# By convention
# principal components are listed in decreasing
# variance order.
   
# The principal component vectors are orthogonal. 
# This means the dot products are zero

# The biplot show two superimposed plot
# that have different scales.
# Such plots run the risk of being
# confusing. 

# The first plot shows the first two principal
# components as points with respect to the
# bottom and left axes. 

head(pc$x)

#  This principal components did not divide the variables
#  by their standard deviations so are based on the covariance
#  matrix of the variables. 

# The second plot in red show values from the
# from the rotation matrix using red arrows
# tips with the arrows starting from the origin.
# The Male arrow tip values can be read
# from left column of the rotation matrix show
# below.  The Female arrow tip values are from
# right column

pc$rot

# The axes for the second plot appear on the top amd right
# of biplot.  Ideally tick mark labels should also
# be red to match the red tick marks, arrows and arrow
# labels. 

# If we read down the rotation matrix PC1 column
# we see linear combination of coefficents that multiply
# the center male and female values for each state to 
# produce PC1.  Roughly speaking the first (PC1) linear combination
# is a negative scale sum of the centered male and female
# values for each states.  Roughly speaking the second linear
# combination is the scaled difference of the center male
# and female value for each state.
# The columns are sometimes called factor loadings.      


# With scaling the Correlation version of PCs

windows(width=6, height=6)

# 6. Percent of variability represented

# Guidance suggest looking the

# components

# cumulative percent of total
# variance 
dfPC$State <- NULL
