            9. Lists

    
1.  R Prompt, comments and assignment syntax     
       
>    R default prompt
#    Comment on the right
<-   Assignment right to left 
=    Assignment right to left
 
## Run: assign the number 3 to the name b 
#       access it by name 

b <- 3
b #   print object b

## End
    
2.   Functions 

Function have names that are followed
by parentheses. The function c()
combines arguments to produce a vector.
Commas separate function arguments

## Run

d <- c(3, 9, 2) #commas separate arguments     
d

## End
 
2.1  Reading a comma delimited file,
     naming, storing and printing objects

Function arguments have keywords that are used
in the function.  We can assign values or R expressions.
to the keywords.  

In the read.csv() example below we
see three keywords, "file","header",
and "as.is" being assigned values.

file = "DowJones.csv"
header = TRUE 
as.is = TRUE  
 
## Run: reading a comma delimited file

DJ <- read.csv(file="DowJones2014Jan18.csv",
   as.is=TRUE,header=TRUE) 
head(DJ)         # returns first six rows by default
tail(DJ, n = 4)  # last 4 rows
str(DJ)          # structure synopsis

## End

The read.csv() function reads a comma delimited
file and created an object called a data.frame.
As instructed, R assigned the data.frame to the
name DJ and stored it in the R session workspace
where it can be accessed by name.

The head() function accessed the 
data.frame called DJ and by default extracted
with the first six rows.  Since the
result is not operated on by another function, R
passed the result to a suitable print function
that displayed the result in the R console.

The tail() function above includes a second argument, 4.
R used this instead of the default of 6. The tail
function then extracted the last four rows of the data.frame.  

Object names normally start with a Roman letter.
R is case sensitive.  Digits can appear after the first
letter.  The period . is also allowed in a name.  

Avoid defining pi, F and T values unless you plan to use them
in nonstandard way and mask R's default values.
R looks for named objects in your workspace before
for it looks in the R folders and package folders.   
  
## Run  

pi
pi <- 13
pi

rm(pi) # remove pi from your workspace
pi     # R's version of pi is now accessible

## End

The search function show the places R will search
to find named objects.

## Run
search()
## End 

2.2  Generating random numbers, function documentation 
     and more about function arguments

## Run: generate random numbers, access documentation 

x <- rnorm(50, mean=100, sd = 5)
x
?rnorm  

## End

The function rnorm() creates a vector
with random numbers from a normal distribution.
The prefix r calls for random numbers.  The "norm"
indicates the normal distribution.  
The first argument tell R we want 50 random observations. 
The next two argument specify which normal distribution,
the one with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 50.  
R assigned the name x to the vector and stores it in the
session workspace.  

Entering the name of an workspace object retreives
the object and passes it to the appropriate
print function and by default the print result appears
on the R Console.  

?rnorm accesses the fuction documentation. 
The document title indicates it is about the Normal Distribution. 
There are similar documentions for other families
of  distributions such as the t distribution. 

The Description section of the document
indicates the four basics functions
provided for all of R's continuous distributions.  
The function names, what they return and the
type of required argument appears below
Required function arguments do not have a default.

Name    Returns                 Required argument      
dnorm:  densities                  quantiles
pnorm:  cumulative probabilities   quantiles  
qnorm:  quantiles                  cum. probs.  
rnorm:  random numbers             sample size. 

Document Sections

In the Usage section we see rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1),
The first argument n is the sample size and has not default. It
much specified when the using the function.  The normal
family of distribution has two parameters, the mean and the
standard deviation use to specify the particular normal
distribution.  The defaults for the mean is 0 and default for 
standard deviation (designated sd) is 1.  The default is
the standard normal distribution.  
 
In the Argument section we see that n
is the number of observations to produce.

The See Also section often shows related functions

The Example section often has instructive examples
that clarify what function needs as input and what
it returns. Addressing a task frequently requires
more than one function, and some examples many address
a task similar to ours. 

2.3  Omitted key words and argument order

When specifing functions, specifying keywords can
make it easier to follow the R script, but typing
can get burdensome. R provides partial matching
so entering enough characters for a unique match
to keywords will suffice.  

So what happen when we don't provide keywords?
 
R first extract the arguments based on matching key words.
Then it matches required arguments to remaining
provided arguments in left to right order.


## Run

# arguments in order
set.seed(37)
rnorm(6, mean = -5, sd=2) 

# s matches sd and m matches mean
set.seed(37)
rnorm(6, s = 2, m =-5) 
 
# remaining arguments in order 
set.seed(37)
rnorm(6, s = 2, -5) 

# last two arguments out of order
set.seed(37)
rnorm(6, 2, -5) # sd=-5 does make sense

## End
 
3. Vectors, statistical functions
   and Basic Datum Types call Modes

We create vectors to use as function
arguments for a variety of tasks. Vectors
may contain many values. Below we
create a vector with 100,000 numeric 
values, check its length, look at 
of the first and last values, and then
compute some common statistics.

## Run

y <- rnorm(100000, mean=3, sd = 4)
length(y)
head(y)

mean(y)
median(y)
sd(y)
var(y)
IQR(y)  # interquartile range

## End

Different tasks require different types of
data. To support a host of common tasks
R supports storing basic R datum types
called modes in it's vectors.  A vector's
values must all be of the same mode.  
(Later we address lists which are more
general data structure whose elements
can even be other data structures.) 

Modes
 
numeric:  
  integer:  3L, -5L
  floating: 2.45,  -1.8e20 
complex:    3+4i, -2i, ... 
logical:    TRUE or FALSE (T or F work if not redefined)
character   "Henry", "Henry's", 'Sue'

Note that character strings delimiters can be 
either quotes and apostrophes.  The first one used
for a string is the delimiter.  If the other
appears it is just another character in the string.  

4. Vector construction

The basic constructor for a vector is the function
c().  The arguments can be a sequence of individual
values, vectors, or functions that produce vectors. 
Below we use the function rep() that will repeat
constant or vector a give number of times.    

## Run

a <- c(3,  -5)
b <- c(2, 4, a, 9, a, 7)
b

d <- c("Henry", "Sarah", "Chungling")
e <- c('Jose', d, "Yongping")
e

f <- c("TRUE", "FALSE", "FALSE")
g <- c(f, rep("TRUE",6), "FALSE")
g

## End

Sometimes we put a constant in a vector of length 1
and give the vector a name so it willed be saved in 
our workspace.  R stores some constants such 
as pi in its workspace.  

4.1  Functions automating vector construction

Thoughtful people often think about repetitive tasks
to find or create ways of saving time that can be used
to think about more interesting things. For some people,
automation itself much more interesting than
repetitive typing.

Thoughtfyk people have created a variety of functions
to expedite vector creation.  Why not let R help?

The function seq() is handy for generating sequences.
The function argument and defaults are 

seq(from = 1, to = 1,
    by = ((to - from)/(length.out - 1)),
    length.out = NULL, along.with = NULL, ...)

Commonly used arguments are from and to
and either by or length.out.  

The sequence operator, : is also handy

## Run sequence generation

x <- seq(3, 23, length=11) # equal intervals, 
x

y <- seq(3, 23, by = 4) # increments of 4
y

ytest <- seq(3, 22, 4) # values must be <= 22 

v <- 33:45
v

w <- 33:26
w

## End  
    
## Application: Drawing a circle

angle <- seq(0, 2*pi, length=100)
x <- cos(angle)
y <- sin(angle)
plot(x, y, type='n')
polygon(x, y, density=-1, col="red", border="black")

## End

The angles above are in radians.  The
last angle, 2*pi, is equivalent to first, 0.
Hence first and last components of cosine
and sine vector are them. There are 99 distinct
pairs of points based on x and y values. 

Change one number in the script above to draw a
hexagon and run the script.

4.2  R's vector replication for mathematics

Mathematical calculations for a pair of vectors work
on the corresponding elements of the vectors. This could
make adding a value to a vector or multiplying a vector
by a single value tedious.

## Run

x <- 1:5
x
xPlus1 <- x + rep(1,length(x))
xPlus1

xTimes2 <- x*rep(2, length(x))
xTimes2

## End

Thoughtful developers provided a way to avoid explict
value replication shown above.  For matched vector
element operations like addition it replicates the shorter
vector to be the same length as the longer vector.
It provides a warning message if the shorter vector
is NOT an exact multiple of the longer vector.

## Run

x <- 1:6
x + 1
2*x

y <- 1:2
x + y

y  <- 1:4

x+y

## End 

## Run Polygon example with vector replication

angle <- seq(0, 2*pi, length=100)
x <- cos(angle)
y <- sin(angle)

# Set up plot scale but don't plot
# x and y values range from -1 to 1
# type='n' prohibits plottings
# axes=FALSE hides the axes 
plot(x, y, type='n',axes=FALSE,
  ylab='', 
  main = 'More Time to Think',
  xlab="This script could be turned into a HappyFace function")

# The happy face is centered at (0,0)
polygon(x, y,
  density=-1, col="red", border="black")

# plot the left eye: shrink circle by .1,
# center it at (-.3, .2)
polygon(.1*x-.3, .1*y+.2, 
  density=-1, col=rgb(.8,1,.8),border="white")
polygon(.03*x-.3, .03*y+.2, 
  density=-1, col="black")

# plot the right eye: shrink circle by .1,
# center it at (.3, .2)
polygon(.1*x+.3, .1*y+.2, 
  density=-1, col=rgb(.8,1,.8),border="white")
polygon(.03*x+.3, .03*y+.2, 
  density=-1, col="black")

# Add a parabolic line for a smile 
xSmile <- seq(-.4 ,.4,length= 50)
ySmile <- -.4 + 1.2*xSmile^2
lines(xSmile, ySmile, lwd=3, col="white")

## End

We can do more with the smile if we use a
polygon instead of a line. The script below
use the rev()function to reverse coordinates
and c() to combine ySmile curve and ySmile2
curve into a polygon boundary.  The two curves
have the same values at x=-.4 and x=.4. 
   
# Run: Plot Mouth

ySmile2 <- -.432 + 1.4*xSmile^2  
polyX <- c(xSmile, rev(xSmile) )
polyY <- c(ySmile, rev(ySmile2) )
polygon(polyX, polyY, col="white", border="white")

## End

5. Operators and Precedence

Does 2 * 3 + 7 = 13 or 20?

R does the calculation as
(2 * 3) + 7 = 13.

Many people are used to the convention
that multiplication takes precedence
over addition and subtraction. Precedence
conventions reduce the need to include a
lot of parenthesis to dictate the order of
operations.
  
The list below includes more than
you will likely need to know for
this class. Read through the list to get
a rough idea about the scope of
operators. You can refer this list later
as needed

The operator precedence is top down
and left to right in each line

        indices delimiters
        I often call indices subscripts.
        We indices use to access part of 
        data structures. 
[]      vectors and list  
[[ ]]   and individual component of a list
[,]     matrix subscripts
[,,,]   array subscripts (not limited to 3) 

::  ::: Access variable name space 

$ @    Component extraction, slot extraction      

** ^   exponentiation right to left

- +    unary minus and plus

:      sequence creation

%any%  special operators
       %*%  matrix multiplication
	 %o%  outer product
       %%   remainder from division
       (I don't about precedence among these) 

* /    multiplication, division
    
+ -    addition, subtraction       

== !=  Comparisons: equal, not equal
< >    less than, greater than
<= >=  less than or equal, greater than or equal     

!      logical negation

& &&   logical "and",  short-cut "and"
| ||   logical "or", short-cut "or"

~      formula

=      leftward assignment   Assigns the object on the right to the name on the left 
<- <<- leftward assignment  "gets" assigns the object on the right to the name on the left

?      help

6.  Vector names, indices and element access

Vector elements can be given names

## Run

height<- c(60, 72, 64)
nam <- c("Sue","Jim","Ru")
names(height) <- nam

height

## End

Vector elements can be accessed by
vectors used as indices.  

Index types can be
  integers indicated position
  character string with element names
  logical values.  

The index vector access the same
element of a vector more than once.


## Run

ind <- c("Ru", "Sue")
height[ind]

subs <- c(3,2,1,3)
height[subs]

height[-3]  # negative values
            # for positions 
            # omit the elements
           
subset <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
height[subset]

taller <- height> 62
taller    # logical vector

height[taller]

height[ height>62]  

## End

Observe that R will evaluate indexing
arguments and make use of the result.

We can replace values in vector

## Run

height
height["Jim"] <- 74
height
height[height<70] <- c(61,65)
height

## End

6.  Matrix construction, indices, access
    and restructuring

Vectors, matrices and data.frames are commonly used
data structures. Later we will use listsand perhaps
data.tables and arrays.     

We start with matrices that restructure a single vector
into rows and columns. The function matrix() is the
basic matrix constructor.
The first argument is typically vector of values used
to fill the matrix.  Two other arguments tell R how
many rows and columns to make.  Normally one of the
arguments suffices since R can calculate other argument
based on the input vector length.  An input vector with 18
elements and specification of 3 rows implicitly means
there will be 6 columns.

If the input vector needs to be replicated to fill in the matrix,
then specifying both the number rows and the number of columns is
required.  Sometimes it desirable to intialize matrix with all zeros
or NA for not applicaable.      

By default R varies the row index fastest when putting
the vector values in the matrix.  Include the argument
byrow = TRUE in the matrix function if you want R to vary
the column index fastest.  
    
Matrices can also be constructed by binding together
a set of vectors as rows or columns.

## Run______________________________

dat <- rnorm(24, mean=10, sd = 2)

mat1<- matrix(dat, nrow= 6)
mat1

mat2 <- matrix(dat, ncol=4) 
mat2

# Test for equality of all components
all.equal(mat1, mat2)

## End

We can transpose a mat2 with the
transpose function t().  As shown below,
the resulting matrix will have six columns.
We can also create this transposed
matrix with matrix() by settting the
number of columns to six and including the
argument byrow=TRUE.

## Run
  
t(mat2)
mat3 <- matrix(dat, ncol=6, byrow = TRUE)
all.equal(t(mat2), mat3)

## End

Matrices can be created by binding vectors 
or matrices together if they have compatible
rows or column.    

## Run
vec1 <- 1:3
vec2 <- 4:6
vec3 <- 7:9
vec4 <- 10:12

mat4 <- rbind(vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4)
mat4

mat5 <- cbind(vec1, vec2, vec3, vec4)
mat5

mat6 <- rbind(mat4, vec1)
rbind(mat5, vec1) # Fails, vec1 to short 
rbind(mat5, c(vec1,0))

## End

Matrix rows and columns can have names
Row and column indices can be these names.
The following shows one way to add
names.  

## Run

vals <- c(105, 126, 207, 63, 67,74, 3, 4, 5, 22, 20, 21)
mat <- matrix(vals, nrow=3)
rownames(mat) <- c("Mary","Jane","Troy")
colnames(mat) <- c("Weight","Height", "Family Size", "Age")
mat

## End

Matrices can have separate row and column indices separated
by a comma. (With a single index the matrix will be
treated as a vector.) For row and column access
the comma is required. This allows the omission of
a row indices to mean select rows. The same applies to
columns.

## Run 

mat[c("Mary", "Troy"), ] # Select the 2 rows and all columns

mat[, 2:3] # Select all rows and the 2 columns 
mat[, -1]  # Select all rows, omit column 1

# Select both  rows and columns
# Note that Height will now appear as first column
mat[c(1,3) , c("Height","Weight")] 

## End

A matrix with a single row or column will degenerate to 
a vector.  

## Run

is.vector(mat)

mat[,2]
is.vector(mat[,2])

mat[3,]
is.vector(mat[3,])


## End

Logical subscripts work too.

## Run

height <- mat[,"Height"]
mat[,height>70]

## End

Just like a vector, matrix values need to be
of the same mode
such as numeric, character and logical. 

Numeric matrices can be used in matrix
multiplication. There are functions
to calculation statistics for each of the rows
or each of the columns.    

data.frames

A common data set stucture has rows for
cases and columns for variables. The column
are vectors and the different vectors
can have different modes. 
Often some columns contain numbers
others contains character strings.
A matrix can't hold such data sets.  

R provide the data.frame structure for
such data sets.  

7. Data.frame construction, indices,
    access and restructuring

Often we create data.frames using R functions
that read files.

The Dow Jones data read in section 2.1
was stored as an object called DJ


# What class is the object
class(DJ)

# Yes it is a data.frame

# Provide a structure synopsis
str(DJ)

# Access to rows and column
# is similar to matrices

# Access by row numbers 
DJ[c(2,3,5),]

# Access by column numbers
DJ[,c(3,4)]

# For data.framees we can 
# access a column using $ syntax
DJ$Company

# Assign row names
rownames(DJ) = DJ$Company

# Select rows using row names

DJ[c("Caterpillar","AmExp"),]

# Access columns by number
DJ[,c(2,3)]

# Access columns by names
DJ[,c("Weekly","Yearly")]

# Degeneration
# A row doesn't turn into vector
# even though all value are of the same type.
DJ[1,2:3]
is.vector(DJ[1,2:3])

# A single column becomes a vector
# an losses it labels
DJ[1:5,2]
is.vector()



8. Factors______________________________________________

R sometimes produces objects in a different class than
we expect. By default R encodes a character string vector
as a factor reading data using function like read.csv().
External data table will often contain categorical variables
such as sex or race with character string values such as
"Male" and "Female" or "White","Black","Hispanic",and "Asian",
respectively. 

Section 2.1 showed using the argument as.is=TRUE
prevent the encoding the character strings as factors.     
Here we address the factor encoding since factorsare useful in model
specification and in controlling the plotting locations associated
factors levels.
 
## Creating a factor in two ways 
## A simple example with 5 cases and two levels

# a character string vector
gender <- c("Female","Male","Male","Female","Male")

# convertion to a factor with as.factor()
gender1 = as.factor(gender)
gender1
levels(gender1)
as.numeric(gender1)

# The first character string in the levels vector,
# "Female" is associated with the number 1
# The second character string in the levels vector
# "Male", is associated with the number 2.  The pattern
# continues if there for each unique character string
# in the character string vector.


# R often uses the factors numbers as plotting coordinates
# for the character strings. One way to control the
# plotting order to put the levels in the plotting order that
# we want and make a new factor. The default order is alphabetical
# some in this example "Female" appears before "Male"  

# We can put "Male" first if we want.  
gender2 <- factor(gender,levels=c("Male","Female"))
as.numeric(gender2)
gender2

as.character(gender1)
as.character(gender1)==as.character(gender2)

# The underlying order of the character string
# vector has remained the same. The encoding
# method has change to obtain difference numeric
# subscripts to the levels

subs <- as.numeric(gender2)
subs

levels(gender2)[subs]
as.character(gender2)

# If you noted that there were more subscripts
# character strings congratulations. This works
# and does what we want.   

##End

9. Lists_____________________________________________

A list structure can have elements of different modes.
The elements themselves can be lists. A data.frame
is a special case of list.    

(Technically vectors are lists because they include attributes
like length, mode, and element names.)  
   
## Run

x = c(1,2,3,4)
y = c(1+3i,4-2i)
z = matrix(1:25,ncol=5,byrow=T)
txt = "A variety of things"

mylist = list(www=x,y=y,matz=z,txt) 
# www,y,matz,txt will be the named components                
mylist

mylist$www         # The $ syntax allows components
                   # to be accessed using the component name

nam = c('www','matz')  
mylist[nam]        # Using vector of component names
                   # to returns a list with the given components.  

subs = c(1,2,4)    # Subscripts given the position also works
mylist[subs]          

mylist[3]          # Note that the result is a list
mylist[[3]]        # A double script will return just the component

## End
