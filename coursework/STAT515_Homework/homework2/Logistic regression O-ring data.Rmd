## 1. Background: Space shuttle O-ring seal damage

Study of possible causes of the Challenger explosion shortly
after launch in January 1986 drew attention to the O-ring
seals in the rocket boosters. The temperature
at launch was much lower than at previous
shuttle launches. At lower temperatures rubber
becomes brittle and less effective as a
sealant. Might this have been the cause of the
explosion? Should the danger have been 
understood by the engineers?    

Edward Tufte said that the failure to
appreciate the danger was strongly associated
with the poor graphics used to look at the data.  
See his discussion and the graphics in
Edward Tufte. 1997. Visual Explanations
pp. 39-53
   
The goal here to model the data as presented
by Julian Faraway.  Faraway refers to Dala, Fowlkes
and Hoadly (1989)for a more detailed description.

This dataset combines observations from 23
previous shuttle missions. Each shuttle has
two boosters, each with three O-rings. The
dependent variable is the number of the 6
O-rings that show evidence of damage due to
blow by and erosion.  

A simple model is that the observations from
each shuttle is binomial dat.  The sample size
is six, the number of trials, n.  The random
variable, x, is  the number of damaged O-rings.
The 23 shuttles provide 23 experiments and are
interested in estimating probability of damage
as a function of the independent variable, temperature.

#  3. Regression Models for Binomial Data

With a simple regression model in mind
a first thought might be to consider a model
of the form:  

1) p[i] = a + b * x[i] + e [i] for the ith mission where 
2) p[i] is the probability of damage,
3) x[i] is the temperature at launch, and
4) e[i] is the error. 

The model could lead to a nonsensical result for some temperatures
because we know that probabilities are limited to values in the closed
interval [0  1], but the model does not enforce this constraint.   

Instead if we use the model  
1. p[i] = exp(a + b * x[i])/ ( 1 + exp(a + b * x[i] ), 
the probabilities are forced to be between 0 and 1.  

Let z[i]  = a + b*x[i]  
1. The right hand side is of form
exp( z[i] ) / (1+exp(z[i]))

We omit the i subscript and consider the function
p(z) = exp(z)/(1+exp(z)).

Since exp(z) >= 0 we can see p(z) is non-negative and less than
1 for finite values of z.  

What happens when z approaches -infinity? 
1) For negative z exp(z)is the same as 1/exp(|z|)
2)As |z| get large this approaches 0.  
3) The denominator, 1 + 1/exp(|z|) approaches 1
4) The ratio approaches 0/1 = 0. 

What happens when z approaches infinity?
Consider adding and subtracting 1 from the numerator.   
1)  (1+exp(z)  -1)/(1+exp(z)) = 
2)    1        -1/(1+exp(z))
3)  The second term goes to 0. The ratio approaches 1.    

Hence 0 <= p(z) <= 1      

Solving p = exp(z)/(1+exp(z)) for z yields
1)  z = log( p/(1-p) )
2) The right hand side is the log of the odds ratio p/(1-p).  
  
Returning to the data at hand we have
1)  a + b * x[i]  = log(p[i]/(1-p[i]) 
The  simple linear combination is effectively
modeling the log odds ratio which is free to
range from -infinity to infinity.

A host of other models for p[i] could be used.
Any continuous monotone increasing cumulative
distribution function with support from -infinity
to infinity will work. 

You might ask what about using the cumulative normal
distribution? Yes, this works and the model
has a name, the probit model. 

The logit and probit models are often used.

A third sometimes-used model is the complementary
log-log function.  This has form z = log(-log(1-p))

# 4. Estimating model parameters

We want to model the probability p, (a parameter
in the binomial family of probability distributions),
as a function of a linear combination of predictor variables.
For several families of probability distributions we can use
the generalized linear model algorithm implemented in the
glm() function.  

Briefly, since this is binomial data and we will be assuming
independent observations given the data. It is straight forward
to write the log likelihood. The standard approach of obtaining
parameter estimates by maximizing the log likelihood works. 
We can obtain estimates for a, b, and p.  The theory also
supports estimating standard errors for the maximum
likelihood estimates.  The p-values are derived from
z-scores = estimate/standardError  
 
##  5. Fitting three models

We started with a linear model and the use 
two general linear models.

### 5.1 Naive linear model

```{r}
linearModel = lm(damage/6 ~ temp,data=orings)
summary(linearModel)
```



### 5.2 Logit model

```{r}
logitModel = 
  glm(cbind(damage,6-damage) ~ temp,
     family=binomial, data = orings) 
summary(logitModel)
```

### 5.3 Probit model
```{r}
probitModel = 
  glm(cbind(damage,6-damage) ~ temp,
     family=binomial(probit),data=orings)
summary(probitModel)
```

## 6. Plots of fitted values

```{r}
plot(damage/6~temp,orings,
  xlim = c(25,85), ylim = c(0,1),las = 1,
  xlab = "Temperature (Degrees Fahrenheit)",
  ylab = "Damage Probability",
  pch = 21,bg = "red",col = "red",
  main = "O-ring Models\nLinear:Black, Probit:Blue, Logit:Red")

tempGrid = 25:85
a = coef(linearModel)
lines(tempGrid,a[1] + a[2] * tempGrid,col = "black",lwd = 2)

a = coef(probitModel)
lines(tempGrid,pnorm(a[1] + a[2]* tempGrid),col = "blue",lwd = 2)

a = coef(logitModel)
lines(tempGrid,ilogit(a[1] + a[2] * tempGrid),col = "red",lwd = 4)

```




7.  Comment

The predicted temperature for the launch time was
26 to 29 degrees Fahrenheit.  The plot from Section
6 shows extrapolated probabilities of damage for this
interval. The probabilities for the two  
generalized linear models are about 1 for this
interval. Even the high probabilities from the simple
linear model would be cause for concern by the
engineers, administrators and crew.    

(Yes, the plot in Section 6 could be redesigned to
draw more visual attention to this low temperature
interval.) 

Without the modeling, Tufte's position-along-a-scale
plot of damage versus temperature would have 
caused concern. Yes, entertainment graphics gathered
by Tufte (and likely shown in class) can fail to
bring out the patterns in the data. In some cases
this can lead to
disastrous decisions. 

Of course it is easy to be critical in hindsight. 
Nonetheless there is reason to push for quality graphics
and for more education so a simple scatterplot is not
considered too advanced for the general public.
